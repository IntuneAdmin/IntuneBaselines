# Intune Baselines (intunebaselines.com)

In this github repo you will find a selection of Intune baseline configurations I made.
These configuration files are free to use but make sure you test them first before you roll them out in your production environment.

# Intune Security Baselines
Microsoft Endpoint Security is an important topic and unfortunately I regularly see that this is not set up within Microsoft Intune.
These baselines are a starting point for your organization and should be checked for correct operation within your environment.

# Modern Work Baseline
In addition to the security profile baselines, there will be various profiles for Windows 11 and iOS / Android
There are currently a number of them, more will be added asap

# How to deploy?
The JSON files can be imported into Microsoft Intune via Powershell or other community tools.
Currently, an import script from intunebaselines.com is being worked on
