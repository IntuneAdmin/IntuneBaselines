# Intune Baselines (intunebaselines.com)
In this repo, you will find Intune profiles in JSON format, which can be used in setting up your Modern Workplace. All policies were created in Microsoft Intune and exported to share with the community.

# Type Baselines
Apple: These baseline profiles apply to iOS / iPadOS. Since I live in the European Union, some baseline profiles will be specifically for European users. These profiles will have 'EU' in their name.

Defender for Endpoint: The baseline profiles for Defender for Endpoint are currently based on Defender for Endpoint P1. These baseline profiles also include SmartScreen configurations, as they work closely with Defender for Endpoint.

Endpoint Security: The Endpoint Security baseline profiles pertain to the Endpoint Security section in Intune. Here, you will find baseline profiles such as Security Baselines, Disk Encryption, Firewall, LAPS, ASR, etc.

Modern Workplace (Windows 11): The baseline profiles for Modern Work include profiles related to the management layer of Windows 11 and the user experience. For example, configuring Outlook profiles, Universal Print deployment, OneDrive profiles, etc.

# Baseline Profiles
These baseline profiles are regularly reviewed and modified based on new developments. Always test the baseline profiles in your own environment before deploying them to production!

# Import / Export
The baseline files are exported with the great tool of Micke-K's called IntuneManagement
See his repo here: https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement With this tool the JSON files can be imported into your Intune environment!

# RoadMap
- Add more Security baseline profiles
- Add more Windows 11 Management Baselineprofiles
- Add more iOS Baseline profiles
- Add some Android baseline profiles
- Add some Windows 365 Baseline profiles.
