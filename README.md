# Baseline Profiles
These baseline profiles are regularly reviewed and modified based on new developments. Always test the baseline profiles in your own environment before deploying them to production!
The baseline policies are a mix of best practices and my own experience regarding configurations. The CIS benchmarks are a mapping to Intune policies from the official CIS benchmark documentation. Currently, the baseline has 267 profiles which can be imported into Microsoft Intune!

# Import / Export
The baseline files are exported with the great tool of Micke-K's called IntuneManagement
See his repo here: https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement With this tool the JSON files can be imported into your Intune environment!
